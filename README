android_raspberrypi_userland_hackfest
=====================================

First of all, I'm not proud of this but sometimes you have to play dirty 
to get shit done!

When your done here, you'll probably want to do this

This repository contains the raspberrypi/userland repo which 
grossly hacked to compile against bionic using the native cmake build 
system hopefully with the android options turned on.

Don't expect this to compile as all the paths are hardcoded
Yes even in the GCC specs file!!

I have no knowledge of how cmake works I just sort of hacked it til
it smelt right and whatd'ya know we got a successfull compilation :)

Pre-compiled version of the libraries can be found in build/lib
Check libGLESv2_readelf.txt for abi stuff etc.
Everything looks like it's ready for android

What the fuck is this for?
==========================

Mainly for sanity testing to see if using the official build system
make any difference. 

Miss-anti-alias
================
A Gralloc will no doubt need providing which "respects" broadcoms 
callback functions

Changes
=======
I've added support for the ANDROID_NATIVE_FRAMEBUFFER_TARGET configuration
attributes in the EGL implementation this is required by Kitkats Surfaceflinger 
although if I can get away with using a v1.0 hwcomposer then the need for 
more concrete support should not be required.

Removed the ./vcos/glibc/vcos_backtrace.c from the vcos library as we are
obviously not using glibc.

Removed Raspicam, Raspistill etc from the host_applications build as it is
currently required and more importantly was causing the build to fail

Still Hungry?
=============
This repo is an temporary place for this stuff. The main project -
Which incase you haven't already figured it out is to Port Android 4.4 ( CM11 ) 
to the RaspberryPI. It's about 85% of the way there and the Missing piece
of the Jigsaw is the Graphics Stack.
If you want to hack on that please follow the instructions found in the 
Readme file of the https://github.com/trevd/android_vendor_broadcom_rpi repository
to setup an RaspberryPI compatible version of CM11 which is based off the 
Androidarmv6 project ( http://github.com/androidarmv6 )
