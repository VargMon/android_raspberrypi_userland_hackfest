android_raspberrypi_userland_hackfest
=====================================

First of all, I'm not proud of this but sometimes you have to play dirty 
to get shit done!


When your done here, you'll probably want to do this

This repository contains the raspberrypi/userland repo which 
grossly hacked to compile against bionic using the native cmake build 
system hopefully with the android options turned on.

Don't expect this to compile as all the paths are hardcoded
Yes even in the GCC specs file!!

I have no knowledge of how cmake works I just sort of hacked it til
it smelt right and whatd'ya know we got a successfull compilation :)

Pre-compiled version of the libraries can be found in build/lib
Check libGLESv2_readelf.txt for abi stuff etc.
Everything looks like it's ready for android


What the fuck is this for?
==========================

Mainly for sanity testing to see if using the official build system
make any difference. 


Miss-anti-alias
================
Probably need to add the egl extensions required by kitkats surface
flinger.
A Gralloc will no doubt need providing which "respects" broadcoms 
callback functions
